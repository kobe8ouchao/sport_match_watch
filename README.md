## 🧠 Why This Project

Most sports live score websites today are:
- cluttered with ads
- slow on mobile devices
- overloaded with features users rarely need

**Sport Match Watch** focuses on the core use case:
> _“I just want to quickly check live scores and match status.”_

This makes it ideal for casual viewers, second-screen usage, and fast access during live games.
